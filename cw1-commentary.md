## Coursework assignment 1
### General remarks
There were three parts to the assignment, requiring essay type answers and making use of referenced sources. Overall many students found a significant number of relevant sources that they used effectively. Some wrote good essays in terms of developing arguments from what they had read, to support their own opinions. Some good answers included examples of locally available works that they had seen and this gave more individual flavour to their work and contributed to good focus in argument.
The most usual general faults were to go off the question topic at times, and not to reference/attribute as directed. This meant that some material taken from elsewhere was not identified, nor distinguished from the student’s work by the use of quotation marks, nor referenced at the point of use, even when paraphrasing a source. Too often there was just a collection of ‘source references’ at the end of a section and no indication of how each had been used. This resulted in significant loss of marks.
